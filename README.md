# [InfiniTime25](https://github.com/Commenter25/InfiniTime25)

Forked, probably clunky firmware for the [PineTime smartwatch](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/), with changes I mostly bodged in from other forks, and from PRs that haven't made it to main.

This is a personal fork, likely not meeting any standards of polish, only really focused on what I want, and will be updated whenever I feel like reflashing my watch. I don't expect anyone else to use this. I will bring any clean and useful changes upstream, or at least give it a distinct home. Though since you're here, if you happen to like my specific combination of things, feel free to use it or fork it yourself!

## Changes

## Credits

I’m not working alone on this project. First, many people create pull requests for this project. Then, there is the whole #pinetime community: a lot of people all around the world who are hacking, searching, experimenting and programming the Pinetime. We exchange our ideas, experiments and code in the chat rooms and forums.

Here are some people I would like to highlight:

- [Atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441/): He works on an Arduino based firmware for the Pinetime and many other smartwatches based on similar hardware. He was of great help when I was implementing support for the BMA421 motion sensor and I²C driver.
- [Koen](https://github.com/bosmoment): He’s working on a firmware based on RiotOS. He integrated similar libs as me: NimBLE, LittleVGL,… His help was invaluable too!
- [Lup Yuen Lee](https://github.com/lupyuen): He is everywhere: he works on a Rust firmware, builds a MCUBoot based bootloader for the Pinetime, designs a Flutter based companion app for smartphones and writes a lot of articles about the Pinetime!
